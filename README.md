Our Ice Cream DBMS, Contains a Create Tables Folder (most SQL files are templates and need to be populated)

- Please Create a new branch and pull from main, after push the branch
    - If you are confident about your changes merge with main
    - If not push the branch and ask someone to review

To Do:
    - Create Tables in TEMPLATED SQL files in CreateTables according to desc, or Edit Created tables in new branch

CreateTables:
    - This has many sql files because sql only allows for an entry that creates a table to be a single entry thus seperating all table creations was required
